Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="1-2-0-migrating-from-1-1-x"></a>Migrating from 1.1.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.1.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

## <a id="1-2-0-migrating-from-1-0-x"></a>Migrating from 1.0.x

The Spring Cloud Services client dependencies were restructured in 1.1.0. To ensure compatibility of your client applications with Spring Cloud Services 1.2.x service instances, you must update your client applications to include the current dependencies and the Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Maven BOM dependencies. For information about upgrading Spring Cloud Services service instances after upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/1-2/service-instance-upgrades.html">Service Instance Upgrades</a> topic. For complete information about the current Spring Cloud Services client dependencies, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/1-2/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a>.

After upgrading a 1.0.x Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance to a 1.2.x version, you must unbind, rebind, and restart any client applications which were bound to the instance. This is due to a change in how service instance credentials are managed.
